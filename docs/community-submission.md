## Artifact attestations

The repository contains `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `actions/attest-build-provenance@v3`. If GitHub Actions is disabled for the owner account, a manual release is still usable for Obsidian, but the Community automated review may show a recommendation about missing artifact attestations until GitHub Actions is enabled and a workflow-built release is published.

## Directory submission

- [ ] Sign in to https://community.obsidian.md.
- [ ] Link the GitHub account that owns the repository.
- [ ] Open **Plugins -> New plugin**.
- [ ] Submit `https://github.com/viggomeesters/obsidian-git-viewer`.

These final steps require the repository owner's Obsidian account.
